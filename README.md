# zenpractice

There are always a few people out there who seem to believe that these sorts of things are extraordinarily important,
and although we do have to write them from time to time in real life, it's somehow never in production code, and nearly
always on a whiteboard...

 # Changelog
 All notable changes will be documented in this file...unless I forget...

 ## [1.3.1] - 2019.07.07
 ### Changed
 - Clean up the code to remove duplicate statements...One might argue that this makes the conditional harder to read, 
 but it's an option. 
 
 ## [1.3.0] - 2019.07.07
 ### Added
 - Merge method to merge two fully sorted arrays.
   - FWIW I have done this in production code. 
 - Mergesort - need to work through this one a couple of more times. I haven't had to do this one in production
 code before, but manually coding it up is still not going to be as fast as using the built in language libraries
 in most cases. 
 
 ## [1.2.0] - 2019.07.05
 ### Added
 - Single linked list
   - Validates get first node, get last node, and recursive reverse list. 
 
 ## [1.1.0] - 2019.07.04
 ### Added
 - Random number helper - generates an array of random numbers, from 0 to n, with unique values. 
 - Bubble sort allowing for ascending and descending sort order. 
 
 ## [1.0.1] - 2019.07.04
 ### Changed
 - Fixed the project structure
 
 ## [1.0.0] - 2019.07.04
